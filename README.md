# Augmented Reality for Visually Impaired People

For visually impaired people, tasks such as navigating unfamiliar environments or reading text can become difficult or impossible without external aid. In this project, we aim to solve the "five-meter problem" using modern augmented reality headsets. Once a blind person has navigated to within five meters of their destination using tools such as GPS, they often have trouble locating their goal, especially if that goal can only be positively identified by reading (non-braille) text.

Our application uses two capabilities of modern augmented reality headsets: spatial mapping and machine vision. First, it scans the environment around the user, creates a map of nearby obstacles, and selectively sonifies those obstacles so that even totally blind users are aware of them. Second, it uses machine vision to recognize text in front of the user, providing them vital information that would normally be inaccessible.

Our tech stack includes Unity, Blender, and C#. 

## Research and Development

For our research, we conducted an in-depth literature review of different solutions, including navigational devices, using spatialized sound in assistive devices, human assisted devices, and augmented reality assistants. This shaped our understanding of the space and informed our subsequent generative user research, where we interviewed academic researchers, visually-impaired people and organizations, as well as others in the assistive technology space.

After a design and development phase, we conducted 7 in-person usability tests with blind users, who were then asked to rate the tasks and provided qualitative feedback on the experience. Overall, the results were positive, and users found the learning process easy and intuitive.
